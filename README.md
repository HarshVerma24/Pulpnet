## 🔍 Technical Details

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup extracts content from IIT Kanpur websites
2. **Text Cleaning**: Removes HTML tags and normalizes text
3. **Chunking**: Splits long documents into manageable pieces
4. **Embedding**: Converts text to dense vector representations
5. **Indexing**: Creates FAISS index for fast similarity search

### Question Answering Process
1. **Query Processing**: User question is embedded using sentence transformers
2. **Retrieval**: FAISS finds most relevant document chunks
3. **Context Assembly**: Combines relevant chunks into context
4. **Answer Generation**: DistilBERT extracts answer from context
5. **Response Formatting**: Returns answer with confidence and sources

## 🛡️ Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling:
- Network timeout handling for web scraping
- Model loading failure recovery
- Empty query validation
- Graceful degradation when models are unavailable

## 🚧 Limitations

- **Data Freshness**: Depends on periodic re-scraping
- **Domain Specific**: Optimized for IIT Kanpur queries
- **Language**: English only
- **Context Length**: Limited by model constraints

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Updates**: Automated data refresh
